<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, there my name is Ahilen. I would like to take the time to thank you for visting my page! Am a Web Developer/ Software Engineer.
  This are my projects i been working on. Am 32 years old and i was formally incarcerated. Which change my outlook on 
  life. As well as my way of life. Am the second oldest of my family and the only girl. I have 3 brothers i can count on!
  I live in the city of Corona Ca. Which i also grow up in most of most of my life. I want to become a software engineer 
  as well along my journey.
</p>

<p>How i choose to become a Wed Developer/ Software Engineer? First i never imagine myself picking a career like this one. But i was introduce  
  to firme coding programs. Which help me develope new skills and a passion to code. I find it very challenging. I've havn't let
  that stop me from reaching my goals and dreams to help othere's like my self be successful. All thought this career is not for ever
  one. This take time and dedication as well as patients!

<p>What i expect to achieve out of my journey as a Wed Developer/ Softwere Engineer? I want to understand all the concepts that surround my work
  field an more. So i can make a application that could help Dyslexic learner understand. Whatever it may be that they are working on to get
  broken down to a simpler format. It can be hard or embarrassing to ask for help at time. So i believe it would be nice to have a application
  just for that purpose.
